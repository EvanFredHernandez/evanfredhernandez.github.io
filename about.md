I am an incoming Ph.D. student to the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) with broad interests in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. 

Before MIT, I contributed to [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/). And before that, I earned a B.S. in computer science and mathematics from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu).

That's it. Bye now.
