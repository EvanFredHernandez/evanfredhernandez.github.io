I will be **GRITTY**. I will be a **VISIONARY**, not a **SOOTHSAYER**. My journey begins by the **NORTH STAR**, not the **MAP**. I will not fear the **MUCK** of the scientific jungle but **HACK** the brush, **DRINK** obstruent rivers to the last drop, and ride my **PERSEVERANCE** to the other side.

I will **QUESTION** everything. **DEATH** to the bandwagon! Dull axes fell no trees, tired words bore keen minds, old ways won’t open new doors. I will research with **FURY**, **SHRED** paradigms paper by paper, and **DEVOUR** the naysayers.

I will become a citizen of the **UNIVERSE**. I am the **FABRIC**, my community the **SEAMSTRESS**. My purpose is to **QUEST** for revelations as **INCLUSIVE** as they are **SIGNIFICANT**. Those who have **NO SEAT** at the academic table shall **STILL FEAST**.

I will achieve my life’s calling **ONE PUNCH** at a time, **ONE ROUND** at a time, **ONE FIGHT** at a time. So **BUCKLE UP** and watch me **BREAK THE FOURTH WALL** of research as I choke on the dust because there ain’t **NO GLORY** without a little **GRIT**.
