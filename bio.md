title: My Life In Four Bullets
permalink: /about/bio/
---

* I was born and raised in Bartlett, Illinois, a small suburb of Chicago. I grew up a devout nerd, always preferring math class to P.E. and Pokémon to kickball. That said, I wasn’t a _total_ loser. In my abundant free time, I practiced the piano and earned a black belt in Tae Kwon Do.

* After middle school, I was accepted to the prestigious Bartlett Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology, a gifted high school curriculum focused on STEM. There, I learned two important things: (1) engineering is cool, but (2) I’m terrified of power tools. I concluded that I should shift my career focus toward computers. Because computers can’t cut your fingers off.

* Like Plankton from Spongebob, **I WENT TO COLLEGE!** I attended the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://wisc.edu) on a [Chancellor’s Scholarship](https://cspks.wisc.edu/) and earned my B.S. in computer science and mathematics with comprehensive honors. During my summers, I lived in the beautiful (read: expensive) cities of Boulder, Boston, and Seattle while interning for Google. Other highlights: I spoke at a [major graduation ceremony](https://livestream.wisline.uwex.edu/DDEEA%202018%20Graduation/) (skip to 50m), I [presented my senior thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.00938) to [important people](https://news.wisc.edu/research-in-the-rotunda-2/), and I discovered a staunch fondness for beer and cheese.

* After I graduated college, I spent a year working as a software engineer at Google in Boulder, Colorado. I developed build, test, and continuous integration infrastructure for [Chromium](https://chromium.org) and [Chromium OS](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os). I bought and still own a lovely condo in Longmont and hope to return to the Rocky Mountain High. Someday.
