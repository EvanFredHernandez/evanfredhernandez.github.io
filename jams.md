I listen to music almost every hour of the day. Working, commuting, exercising, eating, sleeping--I probably have my AirPods in and before you ask, no, I could not hear what you just said.

Whenever I tell someone that I like music, like _really_ like music, their eyes glaze with a challenging look and they ask: "Oh yeah? What genre? What bands?"

My answer: all of them, and too many to name. But if you're looking to jam, or hoping for a glimpse into who I am, here's a list of some of my favorite stuff.
